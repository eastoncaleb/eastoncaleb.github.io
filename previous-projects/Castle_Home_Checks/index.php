<p>Is your lake house your vacation home? Is your home sitting vacant, waiting to sell? <br />Do you have a rental home sitting unoccupied waiting for a tenant? <br /> Do you worry because there is no one to check on your home when you can't be there?</p>

<p>Don't impose upon your neighbor or plumber to check on your home during your absence, they may be too busy themselves to do this for you and may not be insured to perform this service.</p>

<p>Frequently homeowners are not aware that leaving a home unoccupied or vacant for an extended period of time may affect their insurance coverage.  These homes are a greater liability for insurers than an occupied home.  Many policies are not effective after the home has been vacant for 30 or 60 days.</p>

<p>No one is available to detect the problems that often occur before they become major catastrophes - that small leak from the water line to the ice maker can quickly become a much larger headache than ever imagined.</p>

<p>Check with your insurance agent to see what their policy is on vacant or unattended homes.  Your insurer may be able to provide vacant home insurance or provide some other type of coverage option for the period of time that your home is vacant.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, or for whatever period of time your home is unoccupied or vacant, we recommend you hire only a fully insured professional home check company to act as an extra pair of eyes when you cannot be there yourself, after all ............. we understand your home is also your castle!</p>

<p>Having property ourselves in England and America, we understand the requirements of an absentee homeowner!</p>
