        <h2>a little bit about me.</h2>
        <img src="img/photo.jpg">
        <p>I'm a husband and father of 2 beautiful kids. I absolutely love technology and have since an early age. I can remember tinkering with a beige Compaq desktop that my grandparents helped my parents purchase for me. I spent all my free time using it until I had it mastered. As a teenager, I got into PC gaming pretty heavily and I started building my own PCs.</p>

        <p>I started my web development career at the age of 18. I taught myself HTML (version 4 at the time) as well as CSS2 and PHP for the backend and I started a freelance web development business. Because we lived in a rural area at the time, the addressable client base was limited and around 2014, with 2 children, I had to start looking for a full time salaried position.</p>
            
        <p>Unfortunately, there were no dev jobs available in the area so, at the recommendation of a friend, I accepted a sales position and have continued in sales until today but I am anxious to re-enter the devlopment community. I will admit that my relevant portfolio is limited due to the fact that I haven't pursued development in a few years - other than maintaining a few sites for clients - but I have a few projects that I worked on below and also this very website that you're viewing was built between Sept 8-9, 2018 :)</p>

        <p>Although my career did take a detour, I don't view it as time lost. I feel that the business experience and soft skills that I gained - such as speaking to high level clients and executives - are highly valuable and give me an advantage over other potential candidates who only have coding skills.</p>
